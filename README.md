## Project Description
The project aims to integrate a plausible application and collaboration of the two robots, DOBOT Magician and xArm5 outside of a factory setting. The implementation decided is to utilise both robots in a dining kitchen application where both robots will be tasked with delivering different choices of condiments based on the user's input. This will be implemented both in simulation using MATLAB and on the real DOBOT Magician robot.
